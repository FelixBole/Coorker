# COORKER

## What is coorker ?

Coorker is a corkboard type application that will be available for self-hosting. It plans to be minimalistic but allow for some unlimited amount of boards, cards, notes and links which will hopefully be enough to avoid paying a monthly fee to all the big guys doing these kind of apps out there.

This is a hobby side project and will likely not be updated often. It also serves me to learn React in a deeper way.
